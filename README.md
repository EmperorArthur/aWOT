aWOT
==========

Collection of tools to build RESTful stuff with Arduino compatible boards. Only some of the features work on Arduino Uno. There is just not enough ROM and RAM.

It's a hack and under constant change. Prepare to get your hands dirty.

## WoT?

IoT, The Internet Of Things has been a buzzword for the past decade. While IoT focuses on getting devices connected to the global Internet and other existing networks with new novel communication medias and protocols Web Of Things, a sidekick of the IoT, is recycling the current web development patterns and tools to integrate everyday objects to the existing World Wide Web. In WoT the idea is to realize the IoT concept using the current web standards and practices. In order to do so WoT uses the REST architectural style implemented on top of the HTTP already in use all over the Internet.

The WoT concept can be taken a step further to allow the communications over other protocol stacks than the traditional TCP. By implementing the HTTP client and server components so that they donâ€™t directly operate the underlying transport protocol but instead use an abstraction layer we are able to switch the whole protocol stack without making any changes to the actual software logic that is built on top of the components. A device designed to be controlled over Ethernet can be for example be managed over any number of compliant media such as Bluetooth , Wi-Fi, and serial port communications.

## Usage

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <HTTPServer.h>
#include <ServerInterface.h>
#include <EthernetServerAdapter.h>
#include <SerialServerAdapter.h>
#include <aJSON.h>
#include <aJsonStore.h>
#include <MemoryStore.h>

byte mac[] = { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED };
EthernetServer server(80);

// Server interface adapters
EthernetServerAdapter ethernetServerAdapter(&server);
SerialServerAdapter serialServerAdapter(&Serial);

HTTPServer webServer("");
MemoryStore memoryStore;

// Define a handler function
void getModel(HTTPServer &server, HTTPServer::MethodType type, char ** routeParams, char *, bool) {

  char * collentionName = routeParams[0];
  int modelId = atoi(routeParams[1]);

  aJsonObject* model = memoryStore.findModelFromCollection(collentionName, modelId);

  if(model){
    server.httpSuccess("application/json");
    aJsonStream serverStream(&server);
    aJson.print(model,&serverStream);
  }
  else{
    server.httpNotFound();
  }

}

void setup() {

  Ethernet.begin(mac);
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Setup routing
  webServer.onGET("examples/:modelId", &getModel);

  // Populate dummy data
  memoryStore.createCollection("examples");

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++){ 
    memoryStore.saveModelToCollection("examples", aJson.parse("{\"test\":\"test\"}"));
  }

}

// Process incoming requests from serial and ethernet
void loop() {
  webServer.processConnection(&serialServerAdapter);
  webServer.processConnection(&ethernetServerAdapter);
}
```
## Performance

With Wiznet W5100 and Arduino Mega CRUD operations with memory store take ~100 ms and with Teensy 3.1 and W5200 ~40ms.  

## Integration testing

See QUnit example
